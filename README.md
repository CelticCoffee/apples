# apples
js integration practice

This little project is me practicing jQuery and working to acccomplish the same outcome using different tools.
It also represents a turning point in my understanding of javascript.  Everyone needs that moment of confidence when they internally believe "YES I can and will do this."

This exercise, appropriately named Apples, represents that moment for me.
